	<h2>The ending of the Gospel of Mark</h2>
	<p>The earliest versions of the Gospel of Mark end without any details to the resurrection of Jesus, instead ending with Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and the disciple Salome fleeing from the empty tomb. The Gospel of Mark has a much sparser ending than the other Gospels.

<p>Mark 16:5-8:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.
</br>
6 But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, reth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him.
</br>
7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.”
</br>
8 So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
</br></br></p></div>

<p>Most translations of the Gospel of Mark (including the King James Version and the New International Version) include an extra 12 verses. This “Long Version” includes Jesus’ return to Mary Magdalene and telling the 11 disciples to continue preaching his message and perform miracles. This ending is similar to the resurrection narratives of the other Gospels.</p>

<p>Mark 16:9-20:</p>

<div class="verse"><p>
9 Now after he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
</br>
10 She went out and told those who had been with him, while they were mourning and weeping.
</br>
11 But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.
</br>
12 After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.
</br>
13 And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.
</br>
14 Later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table; and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.
</br>
15 And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation.
</br>
16 The one who believes and is baptized will be saved; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.
</br>
17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: by using my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
</br>
18 they will pick up snakes in their hands, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”
</br>
19 So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
</br>
20 And they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it.
</br></br></p></div>

<p>Another ending, a single verse, is less commonly appended to Mark 16.</p>

<p>Mark 16:9:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>9 And all that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around Peter. And afterward Jesus himself sent out through them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.</p>
</br></p></div>
<p>Many Biblical historians now accept that Mark originally ended at verse 8. The first two complete manuscripts of Mark from the 4th century do not include the “Long Ending,” though it began appearing soon after in various sources. The stylist departure of Mark 16:9-20 from the rest of Mark suggests that these 12 verses would have been added after the original, by a different author. It’s possible that the original author of Mark planned a more complete ending and was somehow prevented from doing so, or that the final few verses were lost or considered incompatible with the other Gospels.</p>
