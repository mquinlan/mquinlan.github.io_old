	<h2>The ending of the Gospel of Mark</h2>
	<p>The earliest versions of the Gospel of Mark end without any details to the resurrection of Jesus (though Jesus does allude to his return to Galilee in Mark 14:28), instead ending with Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and the disciple Salome fleeing from the empty tomb. The Gospel of Mark has a much sparser ending than the other Gospels.

<p>Mark 16:5-8:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.
</br>
6 But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, reth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him.
</br>
7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.”
</br>
8 So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
</br></br></p></div>

<p>Most translations of the Gospel of Mark (including the King James Version and the New International Version) include an extra 12 verses. This “Long Version” includes Jesus’ return to Mary Magdalene and telling the 11 disciples to continue preaching his message and perform miracles. This ending is similar to the resurrection narratives of the other Gospels.</p>

<p>Mark 16:9-20:</p>

<div class="verse"><p>
9 Now after he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
</br>
10 She went out and told those who had been with him, while they were mourning and weeping.
</br>
11 But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.
</br>
12 After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.
</br>
13 And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.
</br>
14 Later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were sitting at the table; and he upbraided them for their lack of faith and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.
</br>
15 And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation.
</br>
16 The one who believes and is baptized will be saved; but the one who does not believe will be condemned.
</br>
17 And these signs will accompany those who believe: by using my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
</br>
18 they will pick up snakes in their hands, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”
</br>
19 So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
</br>
20 And they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it.
</br></br></p></div>

<p>Another ending, a single verse, is less commonly appended to Mark 16.</p>

<p>Mark 16:9:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>9 And all that had been commanded them they told briefly to those around Peter. And afterward Jesus himself sent out through them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.</p>
</br></p></div>
<p>Many Biblical historians now accept that Mark originally ended at verse 8. The first two complete manuscripts of Mark from the 4th century do not include the “Long Ending,” though it began appearing soon after in various sources. The stylist departure of Mark 16:9-20 from the rest of Mark suggests that these 12 verses would have been added after the original, by a different author. It’s possible that the original author of Mark planned a more complete ending and was somehow prevented from doing so, or that the final few verses were lost or considered incompatible with the other Gospels.</p>

</br></br>

<h2>Sanhedrin trial</h2>
<p>The Sanhedrin trial of Jesus is an integral element to the Passion. However, most Biblical historians agree that no Gospel's account of the trial can be confirmed historically. No disciple could have witnessed the trial nor would there be any first-hand account of the trial recorded. Instead, the details were likely extrapolated by writers of the Gospels based on tradition and expectation.</p>

<p>Each Gospel portrays Jesus slightly differently in his trial before the Sanhedrin. The Synoptic Gospels all portray Jesus as a stoic defendant who passively defends himself. The Gospel of John, however, bears Jesus in a different light.</p>
</br>

<p><u>Matthew 26:57-68</u>:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
57 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered.
</br>
58 But Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and going inside, he sat with the guards in order to see how this would end.
</br>
59 Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death,
</br>
60 but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward
</br>
61 and said, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.’ ”
</br>
62 The high priest stood up and said, “Have you no answer? What is it that they testify against you?”
</br>
63 But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath before the living God, tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”
</br>
64 Jesus said to him, “You have said so. But I tell you, 

From now on you will see the Son of Man
seated at the right hand of Power
and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
</br>
65 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy.
</br>
66 What is your verdict?” They answered, “He deserves death.”
</br>
67 Then they spat in his face and struck him; and some slapped him,
</br>
68 saying, “Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who is it that struck you?”
</p>
</div>

<p>In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus breaks his silence only once, confirming that he is “the Messiah, the Son of God” which greatly angers the nameless high priest. Jesus fulfills a Jewish prophecy in confirming that he is the Messiah; scholars believe that Matthew was written for a Jewish audience. Likely drawing from the earlier Gospel of Mark, Jesus responds to the Sanhedrin's question with a reference to the Book of Daniel.</p>
</br></br>

<p><u>Mark 14:53-65</u>:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
53 They took Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes were assembled.
</br>
54 Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, warming himself at the fire.
</br>
55 Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none.
</br>
56 For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony did not agree.
</br>
57 Some stood up and gave false testimony against him, saying,
</br>
58 “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.’ ”
</br>
59 But even on this point their testimony did not agree.
</br>
60 Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is it that they testify against you?”
</br>
61 But he was silent and did not answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?”
</br>
62 Jesus said, “I am; and

‘you will see the Son of Man
seated at the right hand of the Power,'
and ‘coming with the clouds of heaven.’ ”
</br>
63 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses?
</br>
64 You have heard his blasphemy! What is your decision?” All of them condemned him as deserving death.
</br>
65 Some began to spit on him, to blindfold him, and to strike him, saying to him, “Prophesy!” The guards also took him over and beat him.
</p>
</div>
</br>

<p>In Mark, Jesus confirms that he is “the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One.” Unlike Matthew, it is explained why the Sanhedrin had trouble finding usable witnesses.</p>
</br></br>

<p><u>Luke 22:41-46 and Luke 22:63-71</u>:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
41 Then he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, knelt down, and prayed,
</br>
42 “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.”
</br>
43 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength.
</br>
44 In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.
</br>
45 When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief,
</br>
46 and he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial.”
</br>
(Similar to Mark 16:9-20, many Biblical scholars believe that Luke 22:43-44 – “Christ’s Agony at Gethsemane” – was not originally part of the Gospel. The physical agony that Jesus goes through would seem to suggest that his suffering is somewhat ‘real’. The addition of these verses could be in reference to the belief of Docetism.)
</br>
63 Now the men who were holding Jesus began to mock him and beat him;
</br>
64 they also blindfolded him and kept asking him, “Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?”
</br>
65 They kept heaping many other insults on him.
</br>
66 When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, and they brought him to their council.
</br>
67 They said, “If you are the Messiah, tell us.” He replied, “If I tell you, you will not believe;
</br>
68 and if I question you, you will not answer.
</br>
69 But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”
</br>
70 All of them asked, “Are you, then, the Son of God?” He said to them, “You say that I am.”
</br>
71 Then they said, “What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!”
</p>
</div>
</br>
<p>Jesus responds differently to the Sanhedrin in Luke. Though he similarly affirms that the Sanhedrin has correctly said that he is “the Son of God” and that he will be seated at the “right hand,” he first challenges the Sanhedrin.</p>
</br></br>

<p><u>John 18:12-14 and John 18:19-24</u>:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>
12 So the soldiers, their officer, and the Jewish police arrested Jesus and bound him.
</br>
13 First they took him to Annas, who was the father-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.
</br>
14 Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one person die for the people.
</br>
...
</br>
19 Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
</br>
20 Jesus answered, “I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret.
</br>
21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I said to them; they know what I said.”
</br>
22 When he had said this, one of the police standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, “Is that how you answer the high priest?”
</br>
23 Jesus answered, “If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?”
</br>
24 Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
</p>
</div>
</br>

<p>The Gospel of John described the Sanhedrin trial in much greater detail than any of the Synoptic Gospels. As well, Jesus' persona is much different: he is not silent when questioned by the Sanhedrin but rather forthcoming with information about his ministry. Jesus does not rely of parables in the Gospel of John and is not like the apocalyptic prophet of other Gospels. His later conversation with Pontius Pilate is also unlike the character of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels.</p>
